Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating unspecified criminal activity by President Trump, according to Cohen.



The Manhattan US Attorney’s office, which prosecuted Cohen, is examining both a conversation between Trump and Cohen that took place two months after the FBI searched Cohen’s properties in April 2018, according to Cohen, as well as other wrongdoing or illegal behavior by Trump.



"I’ve been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues,” Cohen told the House Oversight committee regarding the Manhattan US Attorney’s office when asked about the June 2018 talk he had with Trump, adding that the office was probing that matter.



New York federal prosecutors have pursued two Trump-related investigations since charging Cohen in August 2018: one concerning whether executives at the Trump Organization violated campaign-finance laws in an effort to reimburse Cohen for a hush money payment he made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, and another into the Trump inaugural committee. It’s not clear whether the investigative activity Cohen disclosed during his testimony is related to either of those probes.
